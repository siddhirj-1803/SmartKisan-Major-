## Project Overview

SmartKisan combines a React-based frontend with a Python Flask backend to create a seamless user experience for plant disease detection. The system supports multiple crop types including Rice, Cotton, Groundnut, Maize, Potato, Tomato, and more.

### Key Features
- **Real-time Plant Disease Detection**: Upload or capture images for immediate analysis
- **Multi-crop Support**: Identifies diseases across various crop types
- **Detailed Analysis Reports**: Provides comprehensive information about detected diseases
- **Treatment Recommendations**: Suggests effective treatment methods
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Ask follow-up questions about detected diseases
- **Detection History**: Track and review previous disease detections
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## Machine Learning Model

SmartKisan uses a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with an Adaptive Lesion Module for improved disease detection accuracy. The model:

- Supports 60+ different plant diseases across 11 crop types
- Utilizes adaptive focal loss for handling class imbalance
- Implements attention mechanisms to focus on disease-specific regions
- Achieves high accuracy through transfer learning techniques

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Python (v3.9+)
- NPM or Yarn
- Internet connection for API calls

### Frontend Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already done)
git clone <repository-url>
cd SmartKisan

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Access the application at http://localhost:5173
```

### Backend Setup
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the backend server
python backend.py

# The API will be available at http://localhost:5000
```

### Environment Configuration
1. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```
2. Get your Groq API key from the [Groq Dashboard](https://console.groq.com)

## Usage Guide

1. **Home Screen**: Upload an image or use the camera to capture a plant leaf
2. **Disease Detection**: The system will analyze the image and display results
3. **Detailed Information**: View comprehensive details about the detected disease
4. **Treatment Options**: Get recommended treatments and preventive measures
5. **Chat Interface**: Ask follow-up questions about the disease or treatment
6. **History**: Access previous detection results from the sidebar

## Troubleshooting

- **Image Upload Issues**: Ensure image is in JPG, PNG, or JPEG format
- **Backend Connection Errors**: Check if the Flask server is running on port 5000
- **Model Loading Errors**: Verify the model file exists in the correct location
- **API Key Issues**: Ensure your Groq API key is valid and properly set in the .env file

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion, Material UI
- **Backend**: Flask, Flask-CORS, TensorFlow, LangChain
- **AI/ML**: TensorFlow, Custom CNN, Groq LLM API
- **Data Storage**: SessionStorage for detection history

## Project Cleanup
- Removed redundant code and optimized model loading
- Cleaned up build artifacts and bytecode files
- Added comprehensive .gitignore rules
- Organized codebase for better maintainability
